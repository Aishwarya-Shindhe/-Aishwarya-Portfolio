01 — ABOUT
Data-driven by nature
I'm Aishwarya, a Data Analyst based in Karnataka, India, with a background in Computer Science Engineering and 3+ years of hands-on data management experience.

I started my career managing financial and compliance records — where precision wasn't optional. That foundation gave me a deep respect for data accuracy, validation, and structure that I now bring to every analytics project.

Since 2022, I've been fully focused on data analytics — building dashboards, writing SQL queries, cleaning messy datasets, and turning numbers into narratives that non-technical stakeholders can act on. I'm most at home when raw data is messy and the business question is unclear — that's where I do my best work.
